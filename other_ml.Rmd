```{r pressuresa, echo=FALSE}
numFolds <- trainControl(method = 'cv', 
                         number = 10, 
                         classProbs = TRUE, 
                         verboseIter = TRUE, 
                         summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, 
                         preProcOptions = list(thresh = 0.25, ICAcomp = 3, k = 5))

nntrain <- train(f , data = pp_train, 
                 method = 'nnet', 
                 # preProcess = c('center', 'scale'), 
                 trControl = numFolds, 
                 tuneGrid = expand.grid(size=c(10), decay=c(0.1)))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# f, 
          # data = pp_train, 
```
